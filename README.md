# Alfred Workflows

Here is a collection of useful workflows that I have written for the Alfred v2 Mac OS X application.

Most of these workflows are triggered via hotkey presses.

## List of Workflows

### Internet

* Search selected text in Google [⌘G]
* I'm Feeling Lucky (on selected text) [⌥⌘G]
* Open selected text as URL [⌥⌘O]

### Productivity

* Toggle nvALT (open/hide app) [⌥Q]
* Toggle Wunderlist (open/hide app) [⌥A]
